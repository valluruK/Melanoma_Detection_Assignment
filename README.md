# CNN - Melanoma Detection Assignment
This assignment is a programming assignment as part of upGrad IIIT-B Executive Post Graduate program to build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow for Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection.

### Problem Statement
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


### Dataset 
The below link has the dataset used for this assignment

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.


The data set contains the following diseases:

- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion

## Conclusions

- 'seborrheic keratosis' class has the least number of samples.
- 'actinic keratosis' and 'dermatofibroma' has proportionate number of samples; 'melanoma' and 'pigmented benign keratosis' has proportionate number of samples.
- Accuracy on training data has increased by using Augmentor library.
- The problem of overfitting can be solved by adding more layer,neurons or adding dropout layers.
- The Model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameter.


### Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.0
